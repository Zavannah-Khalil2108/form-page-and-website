    <h1>CODING LANGUAGES</h1>
    <h5>learn the different coding languages, and know what language to use in your next project.</h5>
    <br>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language" and is utilized for coding web pages, HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript</p>

    <br>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is an approachable language that allows beginning programmers to dip their toes in the metaphorical coding pool</p>

    <br>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. JavaScript simply makes web pages interactive and is also where many other languages stem from.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language, often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>typescript</h2>
    <p>TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>MATLAB</h2>
    <p>MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks, designed specifically for engineers and scientists to analyze and design systems and products that transform our world. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages. </p>

    <h2>Ruby</h2>
    <p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. Ruby is mainly used to build web applications and is useful for other programming projects. It is widely used for building servers and data processing, web scraping, and crawling. </p>

    <h2>SQL</h2>
    <p>Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system. It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.</p>
